# üßÆ Practical Session 09 ‚Äì Comparative Genomics

## Introduction

Comparative genomics links genome differences to evolution and function. Conserved genes point to essential roles, while lineage-restricted or rapidly evolving genes can indicate adaptation. In this practical session we start by surveying the dataset, check origin and reliability, group genes into orthogroups to compare species, and end with a test on protein FtsZ to connect results to function.

We will work with a pre-selected set of complete and reference genomes from Pseudomonadota (formerly known as Proteobacteria). These genomes were obtained from the NCBI GenBank database, from which all encoded proteins were downloaded. The corresponding FASTA files can be found in the `~/essentials_bioinformatics_2025/day4/dataset/` folder.

## Part 1: Initial Data Exploration

### - Count Available Genomes
Before we run any tools, we need a basic sense of the dataset. Open a terminal, go to `~/essentials_bioinformatics/day4/dataset`, and count how many genomes are there. Knowing this number helps us choose an analysis strategy that fits the size of the data.

```bash
cd ~/essentials_bioinformatics_2025/day4/dataset/
ls *.faa | wc -l
```

### - Explore Species Diversity
Identify a few species using the taxonomic sampling table in Bash.

```bash
less ../taxonomy_sampling.csv
```

grep -c ">" *.faa | sort -t':' -k2,2n
```

## Part 2: Genomic Databases and Download Options

### - NCBI Genome Database Overview

‚ÑπÔ∏è It is possible to download assembled genomes/proteomes obtained by different research centers and deposited in various public databases. The NCBI (United States), ENA (Europe), and DDBJ (Japan) databases contain annotated and unannotated genomes from organisms across all domains of life and viruses, and they synchronize daily, containing the same information. There are also organism-specific databases; for bacteria, some of the most commonly used are IMG/M (Integrated Microbial Genomes & Microbiomes) and PATRIC/BC-BRC.

### - NCBI Data Access Methods

For the NCBI database, there are different ways to obtain genomes, for example:

#### NCBI Datasets (Command-Line Interface)
NCBI Datasets is the latest CLI for downloading genomes and annotations that lets you search and fetch genome assemblies, and download sequences (genomic, protein) and metadata.

```bash
# Example Datasets commands
# 1. Search for P. aeruginosa assemblies
datasets summary genome taxon "Pseudomonas aeruginosa" --reference

# 2. Download the PAO1 reference genome (GCA_000006765.1)
datasets download genome accession GCA_000006765.1 \
  --filename ~/essentials_bioinformatics_2025/day4/pao1_reference.zip
```

More information: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/docs/

#### NCBI Genome Web Interface
Another option is through the NCBI Genome web interface: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/

### - Explore NCBI Genome Database
Visit the NCBI Genome website, search for genomes corresponding to the phylum Pseudomonadota, and use the **Filters** to refine your results.

#### Understanding Genome Classifications

‚ÑπÔ∏è The strength of our conclusions depends on assembly and annotation quality. NCBI defines multiple assembly levels:

- Contig: Raw contiguous sequences; may contain gaps and unordered contigs  
- Scaffold: Ordered and oriented contigs linked by paired-read information; may still contain gaps  
- Chromosome: Scaffolded into full chromosome sequences; minimal or no gaps  
- Complete: All replicons (chromosomes and plasmids) finished with no gaps or ambiguities  

Reference genomes are usually high-quality assemblies selected as the standard for a species.

üß© **How many genomes corresponding to this phylum are available in this database?**

üß© **How many of these genomes are complete?**

üß© **How many correspond to genomes assembled from metagenomes?**

### - File Types and Formats
Explore the **Download Package** options.

üß© **What type of information and format does each file type present?**

üß© **Which file type corresponds to those stored in `~/essentials_bioinformatics_2025/day4/dataset/`?**

## Part 3: Ortholog Identification

### - Why Ortholog Identification Matters

Identifying orthologs across a set of genomes is one of the key tasks in comparative genomics, and it is often challenging. Orthologs are homologous genes separated by speciation events, while paralogs are homologous genes separated by duplication events.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Why is this important?

- Understanding evolutionary relationships: Orthologs arise from speciation events. Identifying them allows reconstruction of species trees and reveals how lineages diverged over time.  
- Functional annotation transfer: Orthologs usually share functions. Annotations from well-studied organisms can be reliably transferred to less-characterized species via orthology.  
- Identifying core vs. accessory genes: Core genes are present in all genomes of a group and typically encode essential functions, while accessory genes vary and often relate to niche adaptation or pathogenicity.
- Studying gene family evolution: Tracking expansions, contractions, and duplications of genes across species uncovers how gene families evolve, adapt, and acquire new functions.  

The difficulties and strategies differ when we compare strains within a species and when we compare bacteria with archaea. In this practical session, we will work at an intermediate level with representative species from different classes within the bacterial phylum Pseudomonadota.

### - OrthoFinder Tool

‚ÑπÔ∏è We will use OrthoFinder (https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder), a comparative genomics tool that clusters genes into orthogroups, produces useful count tables and summaries, and works well at this taxonomic level and with our data volume. An orthogroup is the full set of proteins across the species in our dataset that descend from one ancestral gene. This set can include strict orthologs and also extra copies created by duplications inside a lineage.

### - OrthoFinder Analysis

We will not run OrthoFinder in class because it might take several hours. We have already executed it on the genomes in the dataset directory using:

```bash
orthofinder -f ~/essentials_bioinformatics_2025/day4/dataset/
```

The complete output is available at /mnt/lab/Data/day4/OrthoFinder/Results_Oct09/. We will use these results to obtain the species-by-orthogroup count table and from it define core sets, single-copy sets, and other variable families.

#### Understanding OrthoFinder Output

```bash
# List the directories generated by OrthoFinder
ls -l /mnt/lab/Data/day4/OrthoFinder/Results_Oct09/ 
```

Some of the output files include:

- Orthogroups/Orthogroups.tsv: Lists all proteins per species in each orthogroup
- Orthogroups/Orthogroups.GeneCount.tsv: Number of proteins per species in each orthogroup

```bash
# Take a look at the format of both files
less /mnt/lab/Data/day4/OrthoFinder/Results_Oct09/Orthogroups/Orthogroups.tsv
# Remember you can press "q" to quit "less"
less /mnt/lab/Data/day4/OrthoFinder/Results_Oct09/Orthogroups/Orthogroups.GeneCount.tsv
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è Orthogroups present in all species approximate the core genome, which is often enriched for housekeeping and essential functions. Orthogroups with exactly one copy in every species are strong markers for species trees, because they minimize problems caused by paralogs. In the next step, we will load the OrthoFinder tables into R and filter them to find the core orthogroups and the single-copy orthogroups across the dataset.

```bash
# Open R
R
```

```R
# Read the gene count matrix
counts <- read.delim("/mnt/lab/Data/day4/OrthoFinder/Results_Oct09/Orthogroups/Orthogroups.GeneCount.tsv", check.names=FALSE)

# Extract only the numeric matrix (drop Orthogroup column)
mat <- counts[, 2:(ncol(counts)-1)]

# Total number of orthogroups
nrow(mat)

# Orthogroups present in all species (every column > 0)
sum(apply(mat, 1, function(x) all(x > 0)))

# Orthogroups present in all species exactly one copy (every column == 1)
sum(apply(mat, 1, function(x) all(x == 1)))
```

## Part 4: FtsZ Protein Case Study

We will now focus on the FtsZ protein, which plays an essential role in cell division in the vast majority of known bacteria. We will identify the orthogroup that contains the *E. coli* FtsZ protein (AAC73206.1) and summarize its distribution. Examining its orthogroup lets us confirm the global patterns and notice exceptions that may point to interesting biology.

```R
# Read the orthogroup membership table
ogs <- read.delim("/mnt/lab/Data/day4/OrthoFinder/Results_Oct09/Orthogroups/Orthogroups.tsv", header=FALSE, sep="\t", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# Find the row containing the FtsZ protein ID
row_index <- grep("AAC73206.1", apply(ogs, 1, paste, collapse = "\t"))
fts_row <- ogs[row_index, ]

# Extract the orthogroup ID (first column)
fts_og <- fts_row[,1]

# Get counts for this orthogroup
fts_counts <- counts[counts$Orthogroup == fts_og, 2:(ncol(counts)-1)]

# Total proteins in FtsZ orthogroup
sum(fts_counts) 

# Calculate numbers of species by copy number category
# Species lacking FtsZ
sum(fts_counts == 0)
# Species with single copy FtsZ
sum(fts_counts == 1)
# Species with multiple copies
sum(fts_counts > 1)
```

üß© **What can we say about the distribution of FtsZ in Pseudomonadota?**

```R
# Exit R
q()
```
